8. For this quesiton, you need to do some research on Linux signals. You can use [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&oq=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzc2MGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get started.
